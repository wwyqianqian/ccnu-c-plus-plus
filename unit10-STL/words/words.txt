i
had
just
learned
your
grief
process
inwhen
my
father
had
a
heart
attack
i
was
with
him
in
the
hospital
for
three
days
until
he
died
he
was
already
brain
dead
when
i
arrived
at
the
hospital
and
the
process
of
his
deathi'll
simply
describe
as
horrific
and
gruesome
nonetheless
i
utilized
your
grief
process
the
entire
time
and
the
experience
was
transformational
for
me
i
never
lost
my
connection
with
what
i'll
call
his
soul
and
still
sense
him
i'm
very
grateful
to
both
of
you
for
your
work

introduction
we
have
been
teaching
the
grief
resolution
process
in
master
practitioner
trainings
ever
since
we
developed
it
over
fourteen
years
ago
heart
of
the
mind
ch
provides
an
introduction
to
this
process
and
a
videotaped
demonstration
resolving
grief
by
connirae
provides
an
example
of
itthis
process
is
quite
often
very
useful
since
the
grief
response
of
emptiness
and
sadness
in
response
to
the
loss
of
a
loved
person
is
something
that
everyone
will
experience
at
some
time
in
their
lives
and
many
people
experience
many
significant
losses
unresolved
grief
is
often
a
major
unrecognized
factor
in
a
wide
range
of
other
difficulties
that
bring
people
to
seek
therapy
includinglack
of
motivation
depression
chronic
illness
and
midlife
crisis
when
we
first
decided
to
model
the
grief
response
we
contrasted
the
experiences
of
people
who
were
particularly
resourceful
in
dealing
with
significant
losses
with
the
experiences
of
those
who
were
still
experiencing
sadness
and
grieving
and
who
had
difficulty
getting
on
with
their
lives
after
a
loss
we
found
that
those
who
were
grievingwhether
longterm
or
shorttermdid
something
that
could
be
described
in
one
of
two
ways
recalling
the
ending
often
they
made
the
mistake
of
recalling
the
ending
of
the
relationship
rather
than
the
loving
connection
itself
for
instance
they
might
recall
the
last
heated
argument
that
led
to
the
breakup
or
the
ugly
divorce
process
the
horrible
terminal
illness
or
whatever
other
unpleasant
events
resulted
in
the
ending
of
the
relationship
rather
than
the
loving
relationship
itself
even
when
they
recall
this
event
in
a
dissociated
way
as
if
seen
ona
tv
screen
the
feelings
are
of
unpleasantness
rather
than
loving
connectionmany
people
recall
these
events
as
if
they
were
happening
here
and
now
with
the
full
intensity
of
the
unpleasantness
of
the
original
eventthis
ending
of
the
relationship
is
not
the
precious
experience
that
the
person
is
grieving
for
and
this
common
mistake
makes
it
impossible
to
experience
the
special
loving
feelings
that
they
had
with
the
lost
person
when
someone
recalls
the
ending
one
of
the
first
steps
in
the
process
is
to
ask
them
to
think
of
what
they
loved
and
appreciated
about
the
lost
relationship
rather
than
the
end
of
the
relationship
this
is
a
request
to
the
client
to
change
the
content
of
their
representation
for
some
people
shifting
attention
from
the
ending
to
a
special
memory
of
the
lost
person
is
a
complete
intervention
and
they
don't
have
to
go
through
the
rest
of
the
processes
below
when
they
remember
the
good
times
as
if
they
are
happening
again
they
no
longer
feel
any
loss
as
dr
seuss
said
don't
cry
because
it's
over;
be
glad
that
it
happened
if
their
image
of
the
end
of
the
relationship
continues
to
intrude
and
trouble
them
you
can
use
the
nlp
phobia
cure
in
order
to
resolve
it
and
you
could
also
use
some
other
intervention
that
examines
the
ending
in
order
to
learn
from
it
and
then
applies
those
learnings
to
future
scenarios
so
that
they
are
prepared
for
any
potential
repetition
dissociation
others
do
recall
the
loving
relationship
but
in
a
way
that
is
distant
separate
absent
or
unreal
resulting
in
a
feeling
of
emptiness
rather
than
the
fullness
that
the
person
experienced
in
the
loving
relationship
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
to
internally
represent
separateness
or
dissociation
you
can
make
an
image
of
the
person
at
a
great
distance
or
you
can
see
yourself
with
the
lost
person
so
that
you
can
see
the
two
of
you
enjoying
each
other
over
there
you
can
see
a
dent
in
the
bed
but
see
that
there
is
no
one
in
it
or
the
image
of
the
loved
person
may
appear
transparent
fuzzy
or
ghostlike
etc
one
person
had
a
relationship
that
had
occurred
mostly
on
the
telephone
and
after
the
person
died
he
could
still
hear
her
voice
but
it
had
a
tinny
quality
as
it
it
were
a
recording
signifying
that
it
was
unreal
with
all
these
different
ways
of
representing
the
person
as
distant
and
separate
the
good
feelings
of
being
with
them
are
lost
there
is
only
a
feeling
of
emptiness
and
this
causes
the
sadness
and
grieving
resignation
when
we
interviewed
people
who
said
that
they
had
dealt
with
their
loss
successfully
we
found
quite
a
number
of
people
who
had
gotten
on
with
their
lives
but
often
with
a
sense
of
resignation
or
quiet
defeat
when
we
asked
them
to
think
of
the
lost
person
they
would
often
sigh
their
shoulders
would
slump
a
little
and
their
breathing
would
become
shallower
some
would
then
say
it’s
ok
but
in
a
somewhat
high
and
strained
tonality
while
this
is
somewhat
better
than
breaking
into
uncontrollable
weeping
it
was
clear
that
their
grief
was
not
resolved
it
was
dealt
with
only
to
the
extent
that
it
was
controlled
so
that
it
did
not
often
intrude
into
their
ongoing
experience
resourceful
response
to
loss
there
were
others
however
who
had
dealt
with
their
losses
in
a
much
more
positive
and
useful
way
when
we
would
ask
them
about
a
loss
there
would
often
be
a
smile
and
softening
of
the
face
and
a
gentle
lift
of
the
shoulders
and
deeper
breathing
they
could
speak
about
the
lost
person
with
softness
caring
and
happiness
one
woman
said
when
i
think
of
joe
it’s
as
if
he
is
right
here
with
me
if
i’m
in
the
supermarket
picking
out
oranges
he
is
right
there
with
me
helping
choose
the
best
ones
just
like
he
used
to
this
kind
of
response
is
clearly
much
more
enjoyable
and
provides
easy
access
to
all
the
special
feelings
that
they
had
with
the
person
who
is
now
gone
these
were
the
people
that
we
studied
to
find
out
how
they
could
be
congruently
happy
about
a
significant
loss
when
we
asked
them
how
they
thought
of
the
lost
person
we
found
that
they
literally
thought
of
them
as
if
they
were
still
present
and
this
gave
them
access
to
all
the
good
feelings
that
they
had
during
the
actual
relationshipthere
are
a
variety
of
ways
to
do
this
often
people
will
simply
think
of
the
lost
person
as
if
s/he
is
nearby
lifesize
and
threedimensional
moving
and
breathing
and
able
to
offer
both
verbal
conversation
and
nonverbal
response
as
if
s/he
were
physically
alive
and
present
in
the
real
world
some
represent
the
lost
person
as
if
s/he
were
physically
present
in
their
heart
or
chest
area
or
present
in
their
whole
body
in
some
way
one
person
felt
the
lost
person
as
if
he
were
a
comfortable
closefitting
sheath
embracing
her
whole
body
others
had
different
ways
of
representing
the
lost
person
but
all
of
them
resulted
in
a
strong
sense
of
the
person
being
fully
present
with
them
in
the
moment
and
easy
to
contact
object
constancy
when
we
thought
about
this
a
bit
we
realized
that
this
way
of
recalling
the
lost
person
is
really
no
different
from
what
most
of
us
do
when
someone
we
love
is
physically
absent
for
a
short
time
think
now
of
someone
who
is
very
special
to
you
in
an
existing
relationship
but
who
is
not
physically
near
you
at
the
moment
and
notice
how
you
represent
that
person
in
your
mind
what
images
sounds
or
voices
and
feelings
do
you
use
to
think
of
that
person?
when
i
steve
do
this
with
connirae
who
is
in
town
on
errands
at
the
moment
she
is
standing
by
my
left
side
lifesize
and
breathing
and
she
feels
present
with
me
as
if
she
were
actually
in
the
room
so
the
good
feelings
that
i
have
had
with
her
are
readily
available
to
me
even
though
it
is
possible
that
she
was
actually
killed
in
a
car
accident
or
ran
off
with
another
man
i
can
represent
her
as
if
the
relationship
still
exists
and
enjoy
all
the
warm
feelings
that
are
part
of
that
relationship
psychologists
have
called
this
ability
object
constancy
and
the
principles
used
in
the
grief
resolution
process
can
also
be
used
to
teach
this
ability
separation
anxiety
object
constancy
is
a
skill
that
smaller
children
have
not
yet
learned
when
mommy
leaves
it
is
as
if
she
is
gone
forever
and
the
small
child
will
weep
inconsolably
in
what
is
often
called
separation
anxiety
luckily
most
small
children
are
also
unable
to
keep
the
image
of
mommy
leaving
in
their
awareness
for
very
long
and
are
easily
distracted
by
other
events
it
takes
some
time
for
the
child
to
learn
how
to
keep
an
associated
image
of
mommy
with
them
so
that
they
can
retain
the
feeling
of
the
comfort
and
security
of
the
relationship
when
she
is
gone
for
a
while
as
the
foregoing
shows
whether
or
not
a
person
thinks
of
someone
as
absent
or
present
is
independent
of
reality
and
whether
an
outside
observer
would
say
that
there
is
an
ongoing
relationship
or
not
it
is
only
dependent
on
how
the
person
represents
the
loved
person
in
their
mind
and
this
is
the
key
to
the
grief
resolution
process
the
essence
of
this
process
is
to
teach
this
important
skill
to
someone
who
is
grieving
about
someone
who
is
now
represented
as
separate
and
gone
since
there
is
a
great
deal
of
variation
in
exactly
how
an
individual
person
represents
someone
as
either
lost
or
present
we
first
have
to
gather
some
information
to
find
out
exactly
how
this
particular
person
does
it
gathering
information
we
ask
someone
who
is
grieving
to
first
think
about
someone
special
who
feels
present
in
his/her
life
although
they
are
not
physically
present
at
the
moment
and
may
be
dead
or
gone
permanently
and
then
about
the
person
they
are
grieving
about
then
we
ask
them
to
think
of
the
two
people
simultaneously
and
ask
them
to
notice
the
submodality
process
differences
between
them
the
loss
will
typically
be
represented
as
distant
and
separate
in
some
way
and
with
a
feeling
of
emotional
emptiness
while
the
existing
relationship
will
be
represented
with
a
sense
of
presence
and
emotional
fullness
there
will
typically
be
very
important
differences
in
the
location
of
these
representations
in
personal
space
for
instance
one
may
be
close
to
the
left
and
larger
etc
while
the
other
is
farther
to
the
right
and
smaller
etc
there
areusually
many
other
differences
one
image
may
be
brighter
than
the
other
or
more
colorful
or
moving
one
may
be
silent
while
the
other
has
sounds
or
voices
etc
these
are
all
differences
that
are
completely
independent
of
the
content
of
the
representations
once
these
differences
are
known
it
is
a
fairly
simple
process
to
transform
a
situation
of
emptiness
and
grieving
into
one
of
fullness
and
rejoicing
usually
taking
the
image
of
the
loss
experience
and
moving
it
to
the
location
of
the
experience
of
presence
is
all
that
is
needed
to
transform
the
loss
into
an
experience
of
felt
presence
typically
the
other
differences
in
brightness
color
movement
etc
change
spontaneously
when
the
location
ischanged
if
these
other
parameters
do
not
change
spontaneously
we
simply
ask
the
client
to
change
them
until
the
loss
experience
is
fully
transformed
into
an
experience
of
presence
when
this
transformation
is
complete
they
will
recover
the
good
feelings
that
they
had
with
the
lost
personwhen
this
occurs
the
client
will
often
cry
but
these
tears
are
very
different
from
the
tears
of
lossthese
are
tears
of
reunion
with
the
lost
feelings
and
it
is
important
to
allow
the
client
to
take
time
to
experience
them
fully
reframing
objections
most
people
are
quite
happy
to
be
able
to
transform
their
grieving
to
a
reconnection
with
the
lost
experience
but
some
will
have
objections
before
proceeding
it
is
very
important
to
respect
these
objections
and
find
out
what
the
positive
outcome
of
each
objection
is
once
the
outcome
is
known
the
task
is
to
find
a
way
that
the
transformation
will
either
not
interfere
with
the
outcome
of
the
objection
or
even
support
it
better
than
the
grieving
does
here
are
a
few
examples
i
don't
want
to
say
goodbye
i
agree
with
you
completely
many
people
have
the
mistaken
notion
that
they
have
to
say
goodbye
in
order
to
stop
grieving
but
that
is
exactly
backwards
what
is
necessary
is
to
say
hello
again
and
reestablish
the
loving
connection
that
you
once
had
with
that
person
one
way
to
convince
a
client
of
the
value
of
reviving
the
positive
lost
experience
is
to
say
to
them
i'm
sure
you
have
heard
about
amnesia
the
forgetting
of
past
events
if
i
could
give
you
complete
amnesia
for
all
your
experiences
of
the
lost
person
it
would
be
as
if
you
had
never
known
them
so
you
wouldn't
grieve
their
loss
now
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
and
i
want
you
to
give
it
careful
consideration
before
answering
'if
i
offered
you
complete
amnesia
for
ever
having
known
this
person
would
you
accept
that
solution?'
of
all
the
people
i
have
said
this
to
not
a
single
one
has
said
yes
driving
home
the
value
of
remembering
the
treasured
experiences
that
have
been
lost
if
i
experienced
the
lost
person
as
being
here
with
me
people
would
think
i'm
nuts
we
certainly
don't
want
that
to
happen
but
i
think
that
could
only
be
a
problem
if
you
talk
to
others
out
loud
throughout
your
life
you
think
of
other
people
and
perhaps
even
have
internal
conversations
with
themi
know
i
dowithout
others
having
any
idea
what
is
going
on
in
my
head
if
i
experienced
the
lost
person
as
being
here
with
me
it
might
interfere
with
my
relating
to
other
people
in
reality
we
certainly
don't
want
to
do
anything
that
would
interfere
with
how
you
relate
to
others
in
the
present
i
think
that
you
would
agree
that
your
preoccupation
with
grieving
for
this
lost
person
has
been
greatly
interfering
with
your
relating
with
other
people
on
the
other
hand
the
way
that
you
think
of
your
friend
gives
you
a
felt
sense
of
connection
that
actually
supports
your
connecting
with
others
when
that's
appropriate
and
i
can
promise
you
that
thinking
of
the
lost
person
will
work
in
the
same
way
and
of
course
if
i
am
wrong
we
can
always
change
it
back
to
the
way
it
is
now
grieving
is
a
way
to
honor
the
dead
i
completely
support
your
desire
to
honor
the
lost
person
and
grieving
certainly
is
an
expression
of
the
depth
of
your
feeling
on
the
other
hand
what
better
way
to
honor
this
person
could
there
be
than
to
carry
him
joyfully
with
you
in
your
heart
for
the
rest
of
your
days?
if
you
died
tomorrow
would
you
want
your
loved
ones
to
grieve
and
be
unhappy
or
to
remember
you
joyfully
with
full
feelings
of
love
and
appreciation
for
your
special
qualities
as
they
move
on
with
their
lives?
which
way
do
you
think
the
person
you
have
lost
would
prefer?
well
i
guess
it
would
be
fine
for
me
to
do
that
but
if
i
were
happy
about
the
person
who
is
gone
my
family
and
friends
would
think
that
i
didn't
care
about
her/him
you
want
to
be
sure
that
those
around
you
don't
misunderstand
you
you
can
either
explain
in
detail
what
you
are
experiencing
and
offer
them
the
same
kind
of
choice
that
i
am
offering
you
or
you
can
simply
put
on
a
sad
face
at
appropriate
times
to
fit
their
idea
of
how
you
should
be
reacting
whatever
the
objection
we
assume
that
it
is
based
on
a
positive
and
worthwhile
outcome
that
the
person
is
concerned
about
and
our
task
is
to
find
a
way
that
the
person
can
proceed
with
the
grief
resolution
process
confident
that
the
objection
will
be
fully
respected
and
its
positive
outcome

resolving

i
reunion
with
the
lost
experience
someone
who
is
grieving
typically
represents
the
lost
person
as
separate
from
them
in
the
past
part
i
of
the
grief
pattern
recovers
this
lost
experience
so
that
it
becomes
an
associated
resource
that
is
fully
experienced
in
the
present
the
following
steps
are
written
as
instructions
for
you
to
learn
this
process
either
with
yourself
and/or
working
with
someone
else
preliminary
step
find
a
break
state
stimulus
if
the
person
is
crying
or
depressed
etc
you
need
to
find
a
way
to
change
this
state
to
a
more
useful
state
before
you
attempt
to
begin
the
process
even
if
the
client
starts
the
process
in
a
good
state
s/he
may
slip
into
grieving
as
you
go
through
the
early
stages
of
the
process
so
you
may
need
to
be
able
to
break
state
later
asking
the
client
to
stand
up
and
walk
around
introducing
a
startling
distraction
or
asking
the
client
about
an
experience
of
resourcefulness
or
competence
etc
will
usually
be
sufficient
to
break
state
loss
absence/emptiness
think
of
an
experience
of
one
of
the
two
following
options
a
an
actual
loss
that
you
are
grieving
about
and
about
which
you
feel
a
sense
of
emptiness
or
absence
or
a
loss
that
you
haven't
fully
dealt
with
yet
think
of
someone
you
are
presently
grieving
about
or
an
unresolved
loss
that
makes
you
feel
uncomfortable
when
you
think
about
it
make
very
sure
that
your
representation
is
of
what
you
valued
and
didn't
want
to
lose
not
the
loss
of
the
relationship
for
example
if
your
child
died
of
cancer
and
you
recall
the
child
as
emaciated
and
comatose
shortly
before
death
that
is
probably
not
what
you
are
sorry
you
no
longer
have
what
leads
to
grieving
is
what
you
valued
and
now
missthe
child's
laughter
and
play
special
qualities
future
promise
etc
if
the
person
just
sees
the
ill
child
or
a
coffin
ask
how
do
you
know
something
valuable
was
lost?
or
how
do
you
know
this
is
worth
grieving
over?
until
s/he
thinks
of
the
valued
experience
not
its
negation
this
step
is
extremely
important;
the
pattern
will
not
work
without
it
and
any
attempt
to
proceed
with
the
process
will
plunge
the
client
into
unnecessary
unpleasantness
b
a
potential
loss
that
you
hope
never
happens
but
if
it
does
you'd
like
to
be
prepared
for
it
think
of
someone
who
is
very
precious
to
you
and
represent
this
special
relationship
but
as
forever
lost
and
gone
you
can
imagine
that
you
have
just
been
told
that
s/he
recently
died
in
a
car
accident
and
use
that
representation
if
you
choose
this
option
you
will
be
doing
pregrieving
programming
in
a
useful
coping
response
to
a
possible
future
loss
calibration
as
the
person
accesses
the
experience
of
loss
notice
all
the
many
nonverbal
responses
that
you
can
observe
in
their
breathing
posture
facial
expressions
etc
so
that
later
in
the
process
you
can
recognize
when
it
is
changed
and
notice
if
this
state
recurs
presence
fullness
now
think
of
an
experience
of
one
of
the
following
a
a
loss
experienced
as
presence
think
of
a
positive
experience
of
an
actual
loss
that
does
not
feel
like
a
loss
even
though
s/he
is
actually
dead
or
gone
you
experience
the
lost
person
as
being
'still
with
you'
in
a
positive
and
resourceful
way
you
can
still
feel
all
the
good
feelings
that
you
had
with
that
special
person
you
have
a
vital
sense
of
presence
or
fullness
when
you
think
of
this
person
as
if
s/he
were
not
lost
to
you
b
someone
you
care
for
who
is
not
actually
present
think
of
someone
who
you
typically
have
available
to
you
in
your
life
but
who
is
not
physically
present
at
this
moment
as
you
think
about
him/her
now
for
example
you
have
a
loving
friend
a
spouse
or
a
child
who
is
actually
distant
at
the
moment
yet
when
you
think
about
this
person
you
experience
him/her
with
you
as
a
present
resource
most
people
can
easily
think
of
an
example
of
this
even
if
someone
is
very
socially
isolated
there
will
be
some
brief
experiences
of
a
warm
relationship
and
if
you
can't
find
one
you
can
help
them
create
one
warning
if
you
use
this
option
be
very
cautious
about
presuppositions
that
may
be
linked
to
this
experience
that
may
not
be
appropriate
such
as
that
the
person
could
always
be
contacted
again
in
the
real
world
you
can
say
we
are
using
this
experience
only
to
find
out
how
you
already
know
how
to
represent
someone
as
present
with
you
so
that
you
can
learn
how
to
regain
the
feelings
that
you
had
in
that
loss
experience
you
and
i
both
know
that
you
won't
be
able
to
contact
that
lost
person
in
real
life
in
the
future
the
way
you
can
with
the
person
who
is
still
in
your
life
calibration
notice
all
the
nonverbal
responses
that
distinguish
this
state
from
the
previous
experience
of
loss
later
you
will
use
these
responses
to
verify
that
the
loss
has
been
successfully
transformed
into
presence
contrastive
analysis
compare
these
two
internal
experiences
of
loss
and
presence
in
order
to
notice
the
process
differences
in
how
you
think
of
them
when
you
think
of
the
loss
experience
what
do
you
see/hear/feel
tactilely?
when
you
think
of
the
presence
experience
what
do
you
see/hear/feel
tactilely?
the
location
of
the
two
representation
in
the
person's
personal
space
is
particularly
important
and
may
be
all
the
information
that
you
really
need
if
the
person
is
in
considerable
distress
move
directly
to
step
make
a
list
of
all
the
submodality
process
differences
between
the
two
for
instance
the
loss
may
be
a
dissociated
still
black
and
white
photograph
while
the
presence
is
an
associated
color
movie
etc
especially
note
differences
in
movie/slide
association/dissociation
and
transparency
testing
submodality
differences
optional
usually
all
you
actually
need
is
the
location
of
the
two
representations
in
space
but
sometimes
it
is
useful
to
know
about
other
differences
and
they
can
give
you
useful
information
for
checking
later
as
well
as
a
valuable
experiential
basis
for
working
with
others
try
changing
each
of
the
submodality
differences
on
your
list
one
at
a
time
in
order
to
modify
the
loss
experience
and
make
it
similar
to
the
experience
of
presence
for
instance
watch
the
still
photograph
and
allow
it
to
unfold
into
a
continuous
movie
of
what
happened
before
and/or
after
the
still
photograph
when
the
still
has
become
a
movie
notice
to
what
extent
that
changes
your
feeling
of
loss
into
a
feeling
of
fullness
change
each
submodality
back
before
testing
the
next
one
in
the
example
given
you
would
make
the
movie
of
loss
back
into
a
slide
before
changing
the
black
and
white
into
color
find
out
which
submodalities
are
most
powerful
in
reducing
the
kinesthetic
feeling
of
loss
and
increasing
the
sense
of
presence
if
you
find
that
changing
one
submodality
automatically
changes
some
other
submodalities
on
your
list
that
is
an
indication
that
it
is
one
of
the
more
powerful
ones
what
we
call
a
driver
congruence
check
do
you
have
any
objections
to
changing
your
experience
of
this
loss
so
that
you
experience
that
person
as
being
a
present
resource?
would
any
of
your
family
members
object
if
you
stopped
grieving
now?
satisfy
any/all
objections
before
proceeding
primarily
through
content
reframing
as
discussed
earlier
transformation
mapping
across
change
the
experience
of
loss
into
one
of
presence
and
fullness
starting
with
the
most
powerful
submodalities
you
have
identified
usually
changing
the
location
of
the
loss
image
to
the
location
of
the
presence
image
will
be
enough
and
all
the
other
differences
will
change
spontaneously
allow
that
image
of
the
lost
person
to
move
over
to
the
location
of
the
presence
image
but
occasionally
it
is
helpful
to
also
suggest
making
other
changes
as
that
image
moves
into
that
other
location
you
will
probably
find
that
it
also
becomes
lifesize
and
threedimensional
and
the
color
will
change
to
pastel
hues
etc
usually
the
content
of
the
representation
remains
the
same
however
at
times
the
content
may
spontaneously
change
or
need
to
be
adjusted
in
order
to
match
the
structure
of
presence
as
the
person
makes
the
change
there
will
usually
be
a
softening
and
relaxation
of
posture
and
facial
features
and
often
tears
these
will
usually
be
the
soft
tears
of
reunion
and
this
is
a
very
good
sign
that
the
transformation
of
the
loss
experience
has
occurred
in
a
powerful
way
however
it
i
can't
always
tell
the
difference
between
the
tears
of
reunion
and
the
tears
of
grief
so
i
always
ask
to
be
sure
i
need
to
check
on
something
with
you
there
are
tears
of
sadness
when
something
is
lost
and
there
are
tears
of
reunion
when
something
is
regained
i
think
that
what
you
are
experiencing
now
are
tears
of
reunion;
is
that
correct?
if
they
are
actually
tears
of
sadness
it
means
that
something
was
missed
in
earlier
steps
and
it's
necessary
to
back
up
one
or
more
steps
to
determine
what
is
incomplete
and
finish
it
before
proceeding
testing
think
of
the
loss
experience
now
does
it
feel
like
a
resource
to
you
in
the
same
way
as
the
original
presence
experience?
is
the
new
representation
of
the
loss
now
the
same
as
the
presence
in
terms
of
the
submodalities?
observe
the
person's
nonverbal
responses
to
see
if
they
match
the
calibration
you
did
in
the
original
presence
experience
step
direction
of
gaze
is
usually
a
very
good
indication
of
whether
s/he
is
thinking
of
the
loss
or
presence
experience
but
there
should
be
many
other
differences
that
will
give
you
the
same
information
if
there
are
still
differences
identify
them
and
use
them
to
complete
the
change
occasionally
a
few
differences
will
remain
between
the
original
experience
of
presence
and
the
new
representation
of
what
had
previously
been
a
loss
as
long
as
the
person
feels
it
as
a
fully
resourceful
presence
it
does
not
have
to
be
a
perfect
match

whatever
internal
resources
and
codings
the
person
already
uses
in

to
transform
an
experience
of
something
lost
in
the
past
into
a
resource

in
the
present
some
people's
natural
strategies
for
getting
over
loss
don't
include
programming
them
to
seek
out
appropriate
nourishing
experiences
in
the
real
world
to
replace
the
lost
ones
it's
possible
that
they
could
feel
good
about
their
internal
resources
and
just
sit
in
a
closet
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
part
ii
is
derived
from
the
most
effective
strategies
for
getting
over
a
loss
and
makes
sure
that
the
person
will
actively
seek
out
appropriate
new
experiences
in
the
future
access
the
valued
experience
take
the
valued
experience
that
you
just
transformed
from
a
loss
into
presence
and
fullness
and
represent
it
in
whatever
way
is
natural
and
easiest
for
you
now
identify
values/outcomes
keeping
that
representation
in
mind
identify
and
represent
in
a
different
location
the
qualities
aspects
values
or
outcomes
of
that
experience
that
make
it
valuable
and
special
to
you
for
example
if
you
lost
a
good
friend
perhaps
you
valued
that
friendship
because
you
felt
that
you
could
just
be
yourself
with
that
person
or
you
enjoyed
the
particular
bizarre
sense
of
humor
that
s/he
had
think
of
the
special
qualities
of
the
relationship
you
had
with
this
personthe
love
comfort
stability
tenderness
humor
spontaneity
or
whatever
else
was
very
special
to
you
about
the
experiences
you
shared
with
that
person
i
want
you
to
think
of
these
qualities
that
made
that
relationship
valuable
ask
yourself
the
question
'what
did
that
relationship
provide
for
me
that
was
valuable?'
as
these
instructions
are
given
it
can
be
helpful
to
gesture
first
to
the
location
in
space
where
the
person
represents
the
presence
and
then
to
a
separate
location
in
the
quadrant
of
the
visual
field
in
which
the
person
constructs
images
usually
upper
right
transformation
if
this
kind
of
experience
with
these
qualities
were
to
occur
in
your
future
what
form
might
it
take?
how
could
you
experience
these
qualities
and
satisfy
these
outcomes
in
different
ways
with
other
people
in
the
future
considering
your
present
age
and
living
situation
etc?
preserving
these
qualities
values
or
outcomes
allow
additional
representations
to
form
gesturing
to
yet
another
location
also
in
the
visual
construct
quadrant
that
are
appropriate
to
who
you
are
now
and
into
the
future
these
representations
will
likely
be
somewhat
different
from
the
experiences
you
had
in
the
past
in
order
to
be
congruent
with
who
you
are
now
and
what
is
realistically
available
to
you
now
and
into
your
future
these
representations
should
be
attractive
and
convincing
but
like
other
future
representations
they
should
not
be
too
specific;
they
should
be
somewhat
vague
and
unclear
allowing
for
a
variety
of
possibilities
and
the
inevitable
uncertainty
of
the
future
congruence
check
do
you
have
any
objections
to
having
these
kinds
of
experiences
or
directions
a
part
of
your
future?
would
anyone
else
in
your
life
have
any
objections
to
this?
objections
at
this
point
are
infrequent
but
if
there
are
any
simply
back
up
to
adjust
the
representations
in
an
appropriate
way
and/or
reframe
to
satisfy
any
and
all
objections
before
continuing
placing
the
new
experiences
in
the
future
next
i
want
you
to
take
this
picture
and
first
make
it
glow
and
then
multiply
it
into
a
stack
like
a
deck
of
cards
as
the
cards
multiply
each
one
will
spontaneously
become
somewhat
different
each
one
a
different
possibility
for
having
that
kind
of
experience
in
the
future
then
cast
these
cards
out
into
your
future
so
that
they
spread
out
and
fall
into
many
different
places
when
you
have
finished
you
will
see
lots
of
little
sparkling
dots
of
light
that
indicate
where
each
card
landed
in
your
future

traumatic
losses
some
losses
are
mingled
with
the
traumatic
shock
of
a
sudden
car
accident
or
the
unpleasantness
of
a
terminal
illness
in
this
case
it
is
crucially
important
to
separate
the
valued
experience
that
was
lost
from
the
traumatic
way
that
it
was
lost
and
treat
these
two
experiences
differently
look
the
loss
that
you
experienced
is
quite
different
from
the
way
that
the
loss
occurred
you
are
grieving
for
the
person
not
the
car
accident
that
caused
his
death
now
i
want
you
separate
the
loving
relationship
from
the
way
that
it
ended
into
two
different
locations
gesturing
in
two
different
locations
in
space
first
use
the
phobia/trauma
cure
ch
with
the
unpleasantness
and
then
use
the
grief
resolution
process
with
the
loss
anger
or
resentment
if
there
is
significant
anger
or
resentment
this
will
interfere
with
the
grief
resolution
so
it
is
important
to
first
resolve
this
using
the
forgiveness
pattern
other
applications
different
content
although
grief
is
usually
thought
of
in
relation
to
the
loss
of
a
loved
person
or
relationship
losses
can
also
involve
the
loss
of
a
thing
an
activity
a
location
or
information
the
other
four
categories
of
what
has
been
called
metaprogram
contentsorting
for
some
people
the
loss
of
a
cherished
ring
the
loss
of
the
ability
to
play
a
lifelong
sport
the
loss
of
a
family
home
or
the
loss
of
special
memories
or
other
information
can
be
as
severe
as
the
loss
of
a
loved
person
often
a
loss
involves
several
of
these
simultaneously;
the
loss
of
a
person
can
also
result
in
the
loss
of
the
activities
and
the
things
that
were
shared
the
location
in
which
those
activities
occurred
etc
the
same
pattern
works
equally
well
with
any
such
loss
as
long
as
the
principal
content
in
the
resource
of
presence
matches
the
content
of
the
loss
loss
of
self
whenever
a
loss
occurs
in
the
world
there
is
also
the
potential
for
the
person
to
experience
a
loss
of
self
someone
who
loses
a
job
may
also
lose
a
sense
of
herself
as
a
valued
employee
and
someone
who
loses
a
child
may
lose
a
sense
of
himself
as
a
parent
and
caretaker
the
grief
pattern
works
equally
well
with
this
kind
of
loss
but
it
is
respectful
to
acknowledge
this
aspect
of
a
loss
which
can
sometimes
be
more
important
than
the
others
loss
of
a
dream
some
people
will
grieve
as
deeply
for
something
that
they
never
had
as
for
something
that
they
actually
did
have
and
then
lost
a
woman
who
has
dreamed
of
having
children
who
finds
that
she
can't
or
a
man
who
has
dreamed
of
corporate
success
who
finds
himself
in
a
deadend
job
may
grieve
as
severely
as
someone
who
loses
a
child
or
a
top
job
that
they
actually
had
even
though
the
person
never
had
the
content
of
the
dream
in
reality
it
was
so
real
in
their
mind
that
the
realization
that
it
will
not
occur
can
provoke
severe
grief
even
someone
who
actually
achieves
their
dream
of
success
often
finds
that
it
is
not
at
all
what
they
expected
it
to
be
and
may
still
experience
this
kind
of
loss
often
this
loss
of
a
dream
is
described
as
a
midlife
crisis
a
dream
is
usually
thought
of
as
being
in
the
future
but
it
can
also
occur
in
the
past
someone
who
has
had
an
abusive
childhood
may
vividly
imagine
the
loving
and
secure
family
life
that
they
never
had
the
grief
resolution
process
also
works
very
well
to
resolve
this
kind
of
loss
pregrieving
can
prepare
you
for
a
future
loss
you
imagine
that
you
have
lost
a
present
relationship
and
go
through
the
same
process
this
is
particularly
useful
for
the
friends
and
relatives
of
people
with
a
terminal
illness
often
the
friends
of
a
dying
person
are
so
upset
over
the
impending
loss
that
they
can't
make
good
use
of
the
little
time
that
they
have
left
with
the
dying
person
and
sometimes
the
dying
person
finds
himself
emotionally
taking
care
of
the
healthy
people
around
him!
pregrieving
is
also
very
useful
for
relationships
that
are
overly
dependent
it
can
release
an
ongoing
relationship
from
the
clinging
behavior
that
is
often
based
on
the
fear
of
future
loss
the
pregrieving
process
is
also
particularly
appropriate
for
ambiguous
loss
in
which
someone
has
disappeared
and
is
presumed
dead
but
could
still
be
alive
the
grief
resolution
process
is
useful
in
a
very
wide
range
of
situations
far
beyond
what
it
was
originally
created
for
many
people
are
troubled
by
unresolved
losses
and
may
have
no
idea
that
these
losses
are
involved
in
the
problems
that
concern
them
the
results
of
using
the
grief
resolution
process
can
be
profound
and
surprising
affecting
a
great
deal
of
someone's
life
it
can
be
useful
to
simply
ask
a
client
about
unresolved
grief
and
deal
with
it
even
when
the
presenting
problem
is
quite
different
and
apparently
unrelated
to
a
loss
this
method
is
quite
easy
to
learn
and
use
the
video
below
provides
a
clear
demonstration
and
the
book
heart
of
the
mind
outlines
the
steps
in
a
way
that
is
easy
to
follow
we
hope
you
find
it
useful
in
your
own
life
and/or
with
your
clients
